# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

After getting a device to connect to BlueConnect in Sprint I, the main goal of Sprint II is getting multiple devices to connect to BlueConnect. For Phase II a cognitive walkthrough will be done on a wireframe with the intentions of highlighting how a user can get multiple connections to the application.

## Methods

During this phase, the methods used were cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback. Cognitive walkthroughs were done for a persona and scenario using the wireframe that was made at the time. The persona was Alex, a person who is experienced with using Bluetooth, and has multiple Bluetooth devices. The scenario was getting Alex to connect his wireless headphones, smartwatch, and wireless keyboards simultaneously to enhance productivity. Alex's goals for the app included device management, customization of connections, and quick switching between devices. The cognitive walkthrough best visualizes how the app flows (not the asthetics of app as wireframes do not focus on design) and helps determine what functions/buttons make sense and what does not make sense for a user. The informal feedback from the Software team is essential in providing what direction the application should take: what features should be added, removed, main ideas, etc.

## Findings

The cognitive walkthrough helped determine that there were some confusing aspects in the wireframe - the mental model of the user doesn't match the conceptual model for BlueConnect. Instead of having a home button for this app, the BlueConnect Banner was implemented as the home button which proved confusing instead of having a simple back button. Another confusing aspect was how a user would access the settings for an individual device. In the wireframe, clicking on the name of a connected device would lead to a screen of that device's settings, but with multiple devices being connected and not a clear button to see more information for a device, users could be confused. The ability to have preset mixes for devices should be implemented to allow users easy access to customize sound mixes. The Informal Feedback helped us question how the conceptual model of BlueConnect should look. There was a change in approach from the Software Team so the UX Team has to follow suit. BlueConnect is now an application that is used to listen to downloaded music so the application must show that. A troubleshooting feature was also suggested by the Software Team.

## Conclusions

Our findings from the cognitive walkthrough helped us to determine a few key things for how the application should flow and be implemented.  Firstly, a more conventional back button is preferable to avoid user confusion when trying to back out of a screen.  Secondly, there should be a clear indicator for how to enter a deviceâ€™s settings, a settings button would prove more understandable. Thirdly, a preset mix for a device is used to allow users to not have to reajust mix settings everytime. The informal feedback from the Software team helped us pivot to where they are - so both UX and Software teams are on the same page. With the Software team's feedback, the wireframe was adjusted to include a help page and how to listen to downloaded music (singularly or via a playlist).

## Caveats

A cognitive walkthrough is not a substitute for a study involving real users, so there could be potential issues with the design that were not brought to light through the cognitive walkthrough (and the number of reviewers conducting the cognitive walkthrough is also limited). Wireframes are still low fidelity so those performing the cognitive walkthroughs might have made certain assumptions about the way the app functioned that could lead to uncaught design flaws.
