# Wireframes

In this folder there are two wireframes: one done with the cognitive walkthrough (the before) and one revised using the cognitive walkthrough and informal feedback (the finalized). The finalized wireframe has each screen as an artboard and will be briefly described below.

## Finalized Wireframe
### Home Screen:
This screen displays the main functions of BlueConnect: the ability to connect multiple devices, adjust the settings of a device, play downloaded music individually or as a playlist, and request help if needed.

### Device Settings:
This screen displays the settings of a selected device. Here a user can see the battery percentage of a device, create a mix, disconnect a device, and go back to the previous screen. The mix has four sliders: volume, lows, mids, and highs. Volume is for how load a user wants a speaker, earphone, etc. to output audio while lows, mids, and highs control the respective frequencies.
