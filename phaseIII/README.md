# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

In this usability test the participants (n = 6)

Methods: Usability Test and maybe Informal Feedback

Describe the methodology so it can be replicated (all the steps described and break down the protocol with reasoning). Quote given task.
 
or upload pdf of protocol and reference it.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!  

The findings in the Usability Test were collated into a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1luWYVmIG-7Ci7HbFj4Ql9mjTNEpF34J8a3IvDMtyEwY/edit?usp=sharing).

Give themes of qualitative data

For quantitative data: percentage of participants that completed a task, percentage of participants that like ... Use a stacked graph (Excel 100% stacked graph)

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

Recommendations from participants that were not in the prototype

Show percentage of some thing and explain why

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

Participants limited to people in this class (not an ideal recruitment scenario)
