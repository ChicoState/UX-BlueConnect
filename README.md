# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* In Sprint 1 BlueConnect features include:
  - Connectivity to previously established devices
  - Basic chat functionality
* These features provide an important foundation that will be built on in the next phase
* Our next goal will be to enable multiple devices to connect at once and enable the application to search and identify Bluetooth products on its own.
