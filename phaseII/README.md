# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

After establishing a connection in phase 1 the main goal of phase 2 was getting multiple connections - there was an issue of having to hardcode the ids for a given device.

## Methods

A cognitive walkthrough done on a wireframe with a user and scenario helped to ...
Informal Feedback from the software development team ...  


## Findings

The cognitive walkthrough helped determine that there was some confusing aspects in the wireframe - the mental model of the user doesn't match with the conceptual model for BlueConnect. Instead of having a home button for this app, the BlueConnect Banner was implemented as the home button which proved confusing instead of having a simple back button. Another confusing aspect was how a user would access the settings for an individual device. In the wireframe, clicking on the name of a connected device would lead to a screen of that device's settings, but with multiple devices being connected and not a clear button to see more information for a device the user could be confused. The Informal Feedback helped question how the conceptual model of BlueConnect should look.


## Conclusions

Our findings from the cognitive walkthrough helped us to determine a few key things about the way the application’s UX should be implemented.  Firstly, a more conventional back button is preferable to avoid user confusion when trying to back out of a screen.  Second there should be a clear indicator for how to enter a device’s settings, a cogwheel next to the device’s name would be an easy to understand implementation.  We also got some informal feedback from the software development team, indicating that some superfluous features such as chat and listen should be removed in order to streamline the app.

## Caveats

A cognitive walkthrough is not a substitute for a study involving real users, so there could be potential issues with the design that were not brought to light through the cognitive walkthrough.  Wireframes are still low fidelity so those performing the cognitive walkthroughs might have made certain assumtions about the way the app functioned that 
could lead to uncaught design flaws.
