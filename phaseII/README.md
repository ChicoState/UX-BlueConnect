# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

After establishing a connection in Phase I the main goal of Phase II was getting multiple connections.

## Methods

A cognitive walkthrough done on a wireframe with a user and scenario helped to ...
Informal Feedback from the software development team ...  

## Findings

The cognitive walkthrough helped determine that there were some confusing aspects in the wireframe - the mental model of the user doesn't match the conceptual model for BlueConnect. Instead of having a home button for this app, the BlueConnect Banner was implemented as the home button which proved confusing instead of having a simple back button. Another confusing aspect was how a user would access the settings for an individual device. In the wireframe, clicking on the name of a connected device would lead to a screen of that device's settings, but with multiple devices being connected and not a clear button to see more information for a device, users could be confused. The Informal Feedback helped us question how the conceptual model of BlueConnect should look. There was a change in approach from the Software Team so the UX Team has to follow suit. BlueConnect is now an application that is used to listen to downloaded music so the application must show that. A troubleshooting feature was also suggested by the Software Team.

## Conclusions

Our findings from the cognitive walkthrough helped us to determine a few key things for how the application should flow and be implemented.  Firstly, a more conventional back button is preferable to avoid user confusion when trying to back out of a screen.  Second there should be a clear indicator for how to enter a deviceâ€™s settings, a settings button would prove more understandable.  The informal feedback from the Software team helped us pivot to where they are - so both UX and Software teams are on the same page. With the Software team's feedback, the wireframe was adjusted to include a help page and how to listen to downloaded music (singularly or via a playlist).

## Caveats

A cognitive walkthrough is not a substitute for a study involving real users, so there could be potential issues with the design that were not brought to light through the cognitive walkthrough (and the number of reviewers conducting the cognitive walkthrough is also limited). Wireframes are still low fidelity so those performing the cognitive walkthroughs might have made certain assumptions about the way the app functioned that could lead to uncaught design flaws.
