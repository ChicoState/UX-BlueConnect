# Wireframes

In this folder there are two wireframes: one done with the cognitive walkthrough ([the before](../wireframes/BlueConnect_Wireframe_Before.pdf)) and one revised using the cognitive walkthrough and informal feedback ([the finalized](../wireframes/Finalized_BlueConnect_Wireframe.pdf)). The finalized wireframe has each screen as an artboard and will be described below.

## Finalized Wireframe
Some brief notes: 
* There is a back button implemented on every page but the homescreen that takes the user to the previously visited screen.
* This is an application done through Android so a phone template was used.                  

### Home Screen:
This screen displays the main functions of BlueConnect: the ability to connect multiple devices, adjust the settings of a device, play downloaded music individually or as a playlist, and request help if needed.

### Device Settings:
This screen displays the settings of a selected device when the "Settings" button is clicked in the home screen. Here a user can see the battery percentage of a device, create a mix, disconnect a device. The mix has four sliders: volume, lows, mids, and highs. Volume is for how load a user wants a speaker, earphone, etc. to output audio while lows, mids, and highs control the respective frequencies. The "Save Mix" button saves the current mix on the screen while the "Load Mix" loads the previously saved mix.

### Song Details:
This screen displays whenever a user double-clicks a song - this can occur when a user is in the "Songs" screen or on a particular "Playlist Details" screen. The user has the option of going to the song before, rewind the current song, pause/play current song, fast forward the current song, or go to the next song. This screen shows that the song details can be reached through the "Songs" screen.
