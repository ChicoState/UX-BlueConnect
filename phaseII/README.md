# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

After establishing a connection in phase 1 the main goal of phase 2 was getting multiple connections - there was an issue of having to hardcode the ids for a given device.

## Methods

A cognitive walkthrough done on wireframe with a user and scenario helped to ...
Informal Feedback from the software development team ...  


## Findings

The cognitive walkthrough helped determine that there was some confusing aspects in the wireframe - the mental model of the user doesn't match with the conceptual model for BlueConnect. Instead of having a home button for this app, the BlueConnect Banner was implemented as the home button which proved confusing instead of having a simple back button. Another confusing aspect was how a user would access the settings for an individual device. In the wireframe, clicking on the name of a connected device would lead to a screen of that device's settings, but with multiple devices being connected and not a clear button to see more information for a device the user could be confused. The Informal Feedback helped to question the mental model of the 


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

Discussing how the final design of BlueConnect would look like with the software team and taking consideration the reviews from the Cognitive walthrough, the final wireframe was adjusted...

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

Again limited to amount of devices...
