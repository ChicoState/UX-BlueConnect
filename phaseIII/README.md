# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

With developing an Interactive Prototype (Using Wireframes made during Phase II) during this phase, a Usability Test was conducted to determine how Effective, Efficicent, and Satisfactory the application was at completing two tasks: Adjusting multiple device settings and creating a playlist. The results are then used to improve the application's design, functionality, and to create a better user experience.

## Methods

The research method for Phase III was a Usability Test (n = 6) done on the BlueConnect Prototype. The [Protocol](../phaseIII/Protocol.pdf) was used by the moderator to conduct the test and data was collected via a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1luWYVmIG-7Ci7HbFj4Ql9mjTNEpF34J8a3IvDMtyEwY/edit?usp=sharing). Below the Protocol will be broken down to assess the methodology of the Usability Test.



## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!  

The findings in the Usability Test were collated into a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1luWYVmIG-7Ci7HbFj4Ql9mjTNEpF34J8a3IvDMtyEwY/edit?usp=sharing).

Give themes of qualitative data

For quantitative data: percentage of participants that completed a task, percentage of participants that like ... Use a stacked graph (Excel 100% stacked graph)

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

Recommendations from participants that were not in the prototype

Show percentage of some thing and explain why

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

Participants limited to people in this class (not an ideal recruitment scenario)
