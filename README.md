# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* In Sprint 1 BlueConnect features include:
  - Connectivity to previously established devices
  - Basic chat functionality
* These features provide an important foundation that will be built on in the next phase
* Our next goal will be to enable multiple devices to connect at once and enable the application to search and identify Bluetooth products on its own.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**
* Analysis from Cognitive Walkthroughs of the current wireframes
  - Users would have preferred a back button over the currently implemented home button
  - Settings button should be an icon rather than the name of the device
* Analysis from informal analysis with Software team
  - Certain features should be removed as they were not useful to users
  - Efficiency should be improved in future designs through streamlining of processes
