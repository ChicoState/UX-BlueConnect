# Wireframes

In this folder there are two wireframes: one done with the cognitive walkthrough (the before) and one revised using the cognitive walkthrough and informal feedback (the finalized). The finalized wireframe has each artboard saved as an image and some will be shown in a demonstration of a persona and scenario.
