## Methods

Cognitive Walkthru created from WireFrames, Informal Feedback


## Findings

From the Cognitive Walkthru and the Informal Feedback...
Meet up with Software team to make a clearer Wireframe...

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!
Moving on to an interactive prototype...

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

Again limited to amount of devices...
