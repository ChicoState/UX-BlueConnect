# BlueConnect

BlueConnect is a mobile application intended to allow the user to seamlessly connect to multiple bluetooth devices and play downloaded music. The user can adjust the settings of connected devices and can create playlists from downloaded music.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* In Sprint 1 BlueConnect features include:
  - Connectivity to previously established devices
  - Basic chat functionality
* These features provide an important foundation that will be built on in the next phase
* Our next goal will be to enable multiple devices to connect at once and enable the application to search and identify Bluetooth products on its own.

# Phase II: Refining Interaction and Designing Wireframes

**Executive Summary**
* In this phase a Cognitive Walkthrough is done with a sample user and scenario for the current wireframe.
  This is done to better understand the user's mental model for the wireframe.
* Informal Feedback from the Software Team is used to understand what limitations there are for the software
  and how the conceptual model of BlueConnect has changed (must pivot to new idea)
* Analysis from Cognitive Walkthroughs of the current wireframes
  - Users would have preferred a back button over the currently implemented home button
  - Settings button should be made more clear (button created called Settings)
  - Option to have preset mixes for a device
* Analysis from Informal Feedback from Software Team
  - Remove the listen button and chat feature
  - Add troubleshooting and ability to listen to downloaded music
* For Phase III the priority it to get devices to output the audio of downloaded music for users to listen to

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

* In this phase a Usability Test was conducted through an interactive prototype (developed from the wireframe in Phase II) and with IRB approval.
* During this phase, there were six participants for the Usability Test that provided formal feedback for the prototype to improve
  the design, button functionality, and understandability of the application.
* Feedback from the Usability Test:
  - There is a lack of continuity as the settings would refresh
  - There should be a notification to inform a user that preset, playlists, etc. have saved
  - Clearer design for the mixer (E.g., a slider that slides instead of being a notch)
  - Make the design of each screen less cluttered
* Quantitative data from the Usability Test:
  - 100% of the participants passed both Task 1 and Task 2
  - 33% of the participants gave Task 1 the User Rating: 3 - Satisfied (Scaled from 1 - 4)
  - 67% of the participants gave Task 1 the User Rating: 4 - Very Satisfied (Scaled from 1 - 4)
  - 33% of the participants gave Task 2 the User Rating: 3 - Satisfied (Scaled from 1 - 4)
  - 67% of the participants gave Task 2 the User Rating: 4 - Very Satisfied (Scaled from 1 - 4)
  - 33% of the participants gave an overall User Rating: 3 - Satisfied (Scaled from 1 - 4)
  - 67% of the participants gave an overall User Rating: 4 - Very Satisfied (Scaled from 1 - 4)
* From the feedback and findings, the application can be further improved with the main focus being improving the settings,
  overall mapping of features, and user feedback for saving (Aforementioned presets, playlists, etc.)
